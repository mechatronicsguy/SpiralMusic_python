# SpiralMusic_python
A python program for visualizing MIDI files, and displaying them in a spiral layout

## Software features
* Simple & open source. Built around Pygame & MIDO library
* Reads ordinary MIDI files
* Different instruments show up as different colours
* Tracks program change messages in order to display which instruments are used on which channel

## Features of the visualizing method: 
* You can see an entire orchestra "Cooperating" to make a chord, wtihout having to read 6 sets of sheet music simultaneously
* Makes it extremely easy to see transpositions (just rotations)
* Melodic inversion is just a mirror flip
* Notes played stay visible for a time as a 'histogram'. Key signature can be inferred from this
* Different instruments (midi channels) are different colours. Can see contributions of each instrument to the whole
